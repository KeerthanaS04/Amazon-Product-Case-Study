## Challenges Faced By Amazon

1. Compromised Cash Flow
   
   The manufacturing process, coupled with shipping, customs clearance, and Amazon payout cycles could mean a merchant gets paid 3-4 months after the advanced payment 
   for obtaining the goods. This way, Amazon sellers are subject to long periods before they achieve any return on their investment in inventory.
   
2. High Degree of Competition
   
   Unless the merchants are selling an exclusive product, they are always competing with a large number of other players. The excessive competition also makes it typically 
   hard to be discovered by enough customers to convert more sales. The said competition isn’t just local. Out of the 900,000 Amazon sellers registered in the United States, 
   almost 38% of them are based out of China where manufacturing goods is a lot cheaper allowing them to penetrate the market with lower prices.
   
3. Packaging Restrictions
   
   The challenges faced by company sellers are the charges for both the delivery and the return from the Amazon warehouse are paid for by the Amazon FBA sellers. This also 
   poses a major opportunity cost since the inventory stuck in transit/inspection could have been sold on other channels. There are various other reasons why Amazon could 
   reject shipments such as unaffiliated shipping partners, failing to meet Amazon pallet requirements, cancellation due to delay, etc.
   
4. Strict Inventory Expectations

   Merchants on Amazon are expected to maintain prescribed levels of inventory at all points. Too little inventory with high turnover means frequent stockouts. High levels 
   of inventory that don’t liquidate for longer periods mean high storage charges and penalties imposed by Amazon. Both situations tend to impact a seller’s performance on 
   the Amazon marketplace.
   
7. High Amazon Fees

   Amazon charges medium to high Amazon FBA fees for its services at every step of the process. These charges range from one-time to regular. As these charges pile up, some 
   Amazon FBA sellers have even recorded up to 53% of their entire revenue going to Amazon in the form of various charges. Even for the FBM or Fulfillment-by-merchant model, 
   sellers have had their Amazon-related costs as high as 27% only for the product listing and any search ads they may have run.
