-> A fair bit of "Traffic" from the very first minute without having to pay for extra advertising

## Challenges and Solutions Faced By Amazon

1. Compromised Cash Flow
   
   The manufacturing process, coupled with shipping, customs clearance, and Amazon payout cycles could mean a merchant gets paid 3-4 months after the advanced payment 
   for obtaining the goods. This way, Amazon sellers are subject to long periods before they achieve any return on their investment in inventory.
   
2. High Degree of Competition
   
   Unless the merchants are selling an exclusive product, they are always competing with a large number of other players. The excessive competition also makes it typically 
   hard to be discovered by enough customers to convert more sales. The said competition isn’t just local. Out of the 900,000 Amazon sellers registered in the United States, 
   almost 38% of them are based out of China where manufacturing goods is a lot cheaper allowing them to penetrate the market with lower prices.
   
3. Packaging Restrictions
   
   The challenges faced by company sellers are the charges for both the delivery and the return from the Amazon warehouse are paid for by the Amazon FBA sellers. This also 
   poses a major opportunity cost since the inventory stuck in transit/inspection could have been sold on other channels. There are various other reasons why Amazon could 
   reject shipments such as unaffiliated shipping partners, failing to meet Amazon pallet requirements, cancellation due to delay, etc.
   
4. Strict Inventory Expectations

   Merchants on Amazon are expected to maintain prescribed inventory levels at all points. Too little inventory with high turnover means frequent stockouts. High levels 
   of inventory that don’t liquidate for longer periods mean high storage charges and penalties imposed by Amazon. Both situations tend to impact a seller’s performance on 
   the Amazon marketplace.
   
5. High Amazon Fees

   Amazon charges medium to high Amazon FBA fees for its services at every process step. These charges range from one-time to regular. As these charges pile up, some 
   Amazon FBA sellers have even recorded up to 53% of their entire revenue going to Amazon through various charges. Even for the FBM or Fulfillment-by-merchant model, 
   sellers have had their Amazon-related costs as high as 27% only for the product listing and any search ads they may have run. 

Solutions for such challenges:

1. Setting up one’s own sales channels such as an e-commerce store. This way a merchant can retain control over sales and also be the direct recipient of payouts anytime a 
   sale is made. This also helps in eliminating Amazon as an intermediary in the payment process.

2. Having one’s exclusive sales channels and marketing mediums provides merchants a chance to create a unique positioning for their products and go one step further in 
   building the brand that they wish to.

3.  Merchants can also choose to buy the recommended packaging material from providers of Amazon Preferred Packaging, but, this again isn’t cheap and may not be suitable for 
    lower-margin products.

4.  Need an algorithmic forecasting and recommendation system to attain optimal inventory levels based on historical inventory and sales data

## Amazon's Marketing Strategy

Key features of Amazon include:

> editorial and customer reviews;
> manufacturer product information;
> web pages tailored to individual preferences, such as recommendations and notifications; 1-Click® technology;
> secure payment systems;
> image uploads;
> searching on our websites as well as the Internet;
> browsing; and the ability to view selected interior pages and citations, and search the entire contents of many of the books we offer with our “Look Inside the Book” and 
  “Search Inside the Book” features.

The community of online customers also creates feature-rich content, including product reviews, online recommendation lists, wish lists, buying guides, and wedding and baby registries. 

The practices for many online retailers, the lowest prices are for the most popular products, with less popular products commanding higher prices and a greater margin for Amazon. 

Free shipping offers are used to encourage an increase in basket size since customers have to spend over a certain amount to receive free shipping. The level at which free shipping is set is critical to profitability and Amazon has changed it as competition has changed and for promotional reasons.

Amazon communicates the fulfilment promise in several ways including the presentation of the latest inventory availability information, delivery date estimates, and options for expedited delivery, as well as delivery shipment notifications and update facilities.

## SWOT Analysis

Amazon is a company in transition, moving from a innovative online retailer to a broad-based web services supplier. Because Amazon provides no breakdown in annual reports, it is not easy to discern the impact of this change, but in general:

**Strengths**

1. A brand well respected for prices and customer convenience.
2. Online trading company that has come through the recession relatively well.
3. Accumulated technological expertise in retailing and customer management technology.

**Weaknesses**

1. Amazon's net margin has been positive, but no better than many brick-and-mortar retailers: 3.2% in 2007, 3.4 % in 2008, 3.7 % in 2009 and 3.4 % in 2010.
2. Amazon's self-publishing facilities will change the publishing industry business model, but the beneficiary may not be Amazon.

**Opportunities**

1. Amazon is poised to exploit the shift to cloud and other third-party services.
2. Amazon's Kindle, which has made ebooks respectable, has conquered only a small part of the publishing industry.

**Threats**

1. Kindle: Amazon has improved the hardware and dropped prices, but many still regard the reader and ebooks as expensive. Cheaper readers will come from China and Korea, and ebook prices may be undercut by Google etc. agreements with publishers.
2. Amazon web services face competition from established providers: Dell, Microsoft and Google.
3. Merchant services compete with a host of Internet Payment Service Providers located across the world.
